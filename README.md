## Description 
In this project I was tasked with creating an application that an employee can use to generate a random password meeting a set of criteria:  
- At least 10 characters but no more than 64
- At least one character type should be selected (i.e. lowercase, uppercase, numeric, special character)

Code should validate for each input and once all prompts are answered, the password should be generated and displayed in an alert or written to the page.

## Usage
Application appearance:
